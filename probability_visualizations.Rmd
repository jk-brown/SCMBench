knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Set-up 

```{r}
source("set-up/libraries.R")
```


We want to read in the probability results for each experiment, add a column for the experiment code, and then cbind rows into a single dataframe.

```{r}
# load data 
dir_path <- "output/probability_results"

# list all files in the folder
file_list <- list.files(path = dir_path, pattern = "\\.csv$", full.names = T)

# experiment names 
exp_names <- c("concentration", "concentration-emission", "emission")

# Read each CSV and add experiment name
probability_list <- Map(function(file, name) {
  df <- read.csv(file, row.names = NULL)
  
  # Drop X column if it exists and is just row numbers
  if ("X" %in% names(df)) {
    df <- df[ , names(df) != "X"]
  }
  
  df$config <- name
  return(df)
}, file_list, exp_names)

# Combine into one data frame
combined_probs <- do.call(rbind, probability_list)
rownames(combined_probs) <- NULL
```

# Start plotting

Now that the data is loaded and the formatting is corrected, we can start plotting. 

I want to compare how the temperature probabilities are different between the different model configs. 

```{r}
# Map original bin factor to friendly labels
combined_probs$bin_label <- recode_factor(
  combined_probs$bins,
  "(0,1]" = "0 to 1.0 C",
  "(1,1.5]" = "1.0 to 1.5 C",
  "(1.5,2]" = "1.5 to 2.0 C",
  "(2,2.5]" = "2.0 to 2.5 C",
  "(2.5,3]" = "2.5 to 3.0 C",
  "(3,3.5]" = "3.0 to 3.5 C",
  "(3.5,4]" = "3.5 to 4.0 C",
  "(4,4.5]" = "4.0 to 4.5 C",
  "(4.5,Inf]" = "4.5+ C"
)

# fancy palette
TEMP_PROBABILITY_COLORS <- c(
  "0 to 1.0 C" = "navyblue",
  "1.0 to 1.5 C" = "#2166AC",
  "1.5 to 2.0 C" = "#4393C3",
  "2.0 to 2.5 C" = "#D1E5f0",
  "2.5 to 3.0 C" = "#FDDBC7",
  "3.0 to 3.5 C" = "#F4A582",
  "3.5 to 4.0 C" = "#D6604D",
  "4.0 to 4.5 C" = "#B2182B",
  "4.5+ C"     = "#67001F"
)


ggplot(combined_probs, aes(x = config, y = probability, fill = bin_label)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge", color = "black") +
  facet_wrap(~ scenario) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = TEMP_PROBABILITY_COLORS, name = "Warming Bin") +

    y = "Probability"
  ) +

    legend.position = "right",
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)
